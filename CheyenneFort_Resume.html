<h1>Cheyenne's Resume</h1>
<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Hello there! My name is Cheyenne. I'm a student here at Seminole State College, finishing up my first year in the journey of becoming a <strong>Production Artist</strong>. I once believed that college wasn't an option for me, both financially and regarding passions. But I was introduced to the idea of graphic design one fateful day, and it synced with my pre-existing love for art and content creating. It teaches me something new every day, even if the curveball hits hard. Thanks to every learning hurdle jumped, I'm currently employed as a <strong>Marketing Assistant</strong>, my dream job!

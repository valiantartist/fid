In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>
<p>Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time datetime="20161130">November 30</time>.</p><P>Location: Baker's Corner, Seekonk, MA</P><P>Hours: Tuesday to Saturday, 11am to 11pm</P></body><small>All content copyright &copy; 2017, Black Goose Bistro and Jennifer Robbins</small>
